# officemap
JQuery / JavaScript solution to identify and locate cubicles on office floor in SharePoint

Using various functions available here:
http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/ - highlighting html map regions
https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo - jquery table scrolling 
http://spservices.codeplex.com/ - jQuery library for SharePoint web services

I have put them together to create an office map that is based on an existing telephone list on SharePoint.  Users are assigned cubicles that are highlighted on the office map when the users hovers the mouse over the cubicle designation.  Office administration can also quickly identify empty cubicles because the cubicles are highlited in grey.

The need arose because despite the original office planner's best efforts, our office cubicles are not numbered or arranged in an ideal or logical sense.
